# Project Movies

The assignment was to make a page displaying popular movies in a list and when you clicked them it should take user to a page where user can got some more info about that specific movie.
- To achieve that I uesd fetch method to fetch data from an api. This app is React Router Freamwork (useState, useEffect, and  UseParams)hook.

## The problem

First real challenge was to understand the useParams that make a get request for each specific movie once user clicked them. To actually get it to work was a challenge, but wrapping the header around what was going on took some time.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
